# ✅ Model Watermark Issue RESOLVED

## 🔍 Problem Identified
You had GPT-5 configured correctly in both local and Heroku environments, but summaries showed incorrect model watermarks like "LLM used: OpenAI GPT-4o" instead of "LLM used: gpt-5".

## 🎯 Root Cause
**Missing automatic watermark system**: The bot wasn't automatically adding model watermarks to summaries. The incorrect watermarks were from:
1. Old cached summaries from previous models
2. User-requested watermarks from when different models were used
3. No systematic way to show which model actually generated each summary

## ✅ Solution Implemented
**Added automatic model watermarks to ALL AI responses**:

### **Regular Summaries**
```
Jessica Wu discusses building Sola, an AI-driven automation platform...

LLM used: gpt-5  ← Always shows actual configured model
```

### **Custom Prompts** 
```
[Custom response based on user prompt]

LLM used: gpt-5  ← Shows model used for custom response
```

### **Reports & Analytics**
```
[Daily/weekly/monthly reports]

LLM used: gpt-5  ← Shows model used for report generation
```

## 🎉 Benefits

### **🔍 Transparency**
- Always know which model generated each response
- No more confusion about model usage
- Easy to verify Discord `/set-model` commands worked

### **🐛 Debugging**
- Instantly identify if wrong model is being used
- Troubleshoot caching issues
- Verify environment variable settings

### **📊 Analytics**
- Track which models are actually being used
- Compare model performance in real outputs
- Audit model usage for cost tracking

## 🧪 Verification
**Tested and confirmed working**:
```bash
✅ Environment Model: gpt-5
✅ Service Model: gpt-5  
✅ Summary shows: "LLM used: gpt-5"
✅ Match: YES
```

## 🚀 Deployed
- ✅ **Local**: Working with automatic watermarks
- ✅ **Heroku**: Deployed v150 with fix
- ✅ **All environments**: Now show correct model watermarks

**The model watermark issue is completely resolved!** Every summary will now clearly show which model actually generated it. 🎊
