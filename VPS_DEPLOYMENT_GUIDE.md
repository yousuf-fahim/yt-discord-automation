# VPS Deployment Alternative

## Recommended VPS Providers

### DigitalOcean ($6-12/month)
- Some datacenter IPs work with YouTube
- Easy deployment with Docker
- 99%+ uptime

### Linode ($5-10/month)
- Good YouTube compatibility
- Simple setup process

### Traditional Hosting (Best Success Rate)
- Shared hosting providers often have residential-class IPs
- Examples: DreamHost, Bluehost, SiteGround

## Migration Steps

1. **Keep Discord bot on Heroku** (it works fine)
2. **Move only transcript service to VPS**
3. **Create API endpoint** for transcript requests
4. **Update bot to call VPS API**

## Architecture:
```
Discord Bot (Heroku) → VPS Transcript API → YouTube
                    ↓
                Discord Response
```

## Implementation:
1. Deploy transcript service on VPS
2. Expose REST API: `GET /transcript/:videoId`
3. Update Discord service to call VPS endpoint
4. Keep all other functionality on Heroku

## Cost:
- Heroku: Free (current bot)
- VPS: $5-12/month
- Total: $5-12/month vs $10-30/month for proxies
