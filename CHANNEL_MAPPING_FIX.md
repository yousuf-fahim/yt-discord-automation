# Channel Mapping Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
Reports were being sent to the wrong channels due to incorrect channel name mapping logic.

## Root Cause
The bot was trying to send reports to numbered channels (e.g., `daily-report-1`, `weekly-report-1`) based on prompt channel suffixes, but the actual Discord channels were named without numbers (`#daily-report`, `#weekly-report`, `#monthly-report`).

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Daily Report Channel Mapping
**File:** `src/services/discord.service.js` (lines ~842)
- **Before:** Always tried `daily-report-{suffix}` first
- **After:** Tries `daily-report-{suffix}` if suffix exists, then falls back to `daily-report`

### 2. Fixed Weekly Report Channel Mapping  
**File:** `src/services/discord.service.js` (lines ~980)
- **Before:** Always tried `weekly-report-{suffix}` first
- **After:** Tries `weekly-report-{suffix}` if suffix exists, then falls back to `weekly-report`

### 3. Fixed Monthly Report Channel Mapping
**File:** `src/services/discord.service.js` (lines ~1091)  
- **Before:** Always tried `monthly-report-{suffix}` first
- **After:** Tries `monthly-report-{suffix}` if suffix exists, then falls back to `monthly-report`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Channel Resolution Order:
1. **Numbered channel** (if prompt has suffix): `daily-report-1`, `weekly-report-1`, etc.
2. **Base channel**: `daily-report`, `weekly-report`, `monthly-report`
3. **Fallback channels**: general, bot, or channels containing the report type

### For Your Discord Setup:
- âœ… Daily reports â†’ `#daily-report` channel
- âœ… Weekly reports â†’ `#weekly-report` channel  
- âœ… Monthly reports â†’ `#monthly-report` channel

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Run the verification script:**
   ```bash
   node verify-channels.js
   ```

2. **Test with bot commands:**
   - Use `!trigger-reports all` to manually trigger reports
   - Check if they appear in the correct channels

3. **Monitor scheduled reports:**
   - Daily: 18:00 CEST
   - Weekly: Sundays 19:00 CEST
   - Monthly: 1st of month 20:00 CEST

## Files Modified
- âœ… `src/services/discord.service.js` - Main channel mapping logic
- âœ… `test-channel-mapping.js` - Test script to verify logic
- âœ… `verify-channels.js` - Live verification script

## Backward Compatibility
The fix maintains backward compatibility:
- Still works with numbered channels if they exist
- Falls back gracefully to base channels
- Preserves existing fallback mechanisms

Reports should now go to the correct channels! ðŸŽ¯
