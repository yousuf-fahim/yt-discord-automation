1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,120
many of you have probably seen my\h
recent appearance on Jubilee if you\h\h

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,920
haven't definitely check it out it's linked\h
in the description but the response has been\h\h

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,200
weird i've gotten some of the strangest\h
comments I've ever gotten in my career\h\h

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,800
while on social media and we're going to\h
talk about that but first let me give you\h\h

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,360
a little behind the scenes of what happened\h
in order to make this debate actually happen

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,040
i was watching Jubilee and saw a 20 verse one\h
episode and I said "Wow wouldn't it be a good\h\h

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,240
idea if it was a doctor verse antiaxer?" So I\h
had Sam shoot them an email and recommend the\h\h

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,760
idea for an episode and actually volunteer to be\h
the one in the middle they love the idea and they\h\h

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,480
said that they would absolutely be interested\h
in doing it so we went and right away started\h\h

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,880
scheduling it sam and I flew ourselves out to Los\h
Angeles where they filmed these episodes and the\h\h

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,280
participants didn't even know I was coming so that\h
was completely news to them i walk out into this\h\h

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,440
circle lights are on cameras already rolling i get\h
like a few giggles some applause some groans feel\h\h

13
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,960
totally nervous being in this cold environment\h
get into this uncomfy chair which impacted my\h\h

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,200
posture and we'll talk about that in a bit i was\h
actually surprised by the diversity of people not\h\h

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,800
based on their demographics but based on their\h
beliefs about vaccines there were people who were\h\h

16
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,760
vehemently antivaccine you could sense it from\h
them they got emotional there were individuals\h\h

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,320
who just had questions there were some people\h
that were skeptical of certain vaccines but not\h\h

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,960
other vaccines others were involved in legal\h
battles surrounding vaccines so it was such a\h\h

19
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,360
diverse group of people but what I will say that\h
they all had in common was they were all pretty\h\h

20
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,160
polite and nice to me and that was very welcome\h
and I very much appreciated that i even called\h\h

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,800
it out during the debate when it comes to how I\h
was feeling during the debate i just wanted to\h\h

22
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,920
make sure I was saying everything accurately so I\h
spoke more slowly than I would watching a Grey's\h\h

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,280
Anatomy or the pit reaction i was very careful to\h
make sure that I was presented accurate info that\h\h

24
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,880
I didn't misspeak on things to very clearly and\h
confidently say I don't know as much as I could\h\h

25
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,040
to show that you have to be transparent and to\h
also own the failures of past mistakes that the\h\h

26
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,000
medical community has made because guess what we\h
made those and a lot of the comments that came in\h\h

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,720
when the debate went live was people being very\h
thankful and kind to me calling me a saint i'm\h\h

28
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,200
a better person than they are cuz they would have\h
gotten really mad and what that taught me was that\h\h

29
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,640
people are very angry and emotional and I get that\h
but at the same time it told me how much people\h\h

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,120
don't know about what doctors actually do we spend\h
hours every single day doing our best to educate\h\h

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,840
patients on topics that they're not familiar with\h
that they've learned some misinformation about\h\h

32
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,960
that they're perhaps very passionate culturally\h
about and we have to approach that with a very\h\h

33
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,920
empathetic patient mindset so what you saw on\h
camera was what happens behind closed doors during\h\h

34
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,720
a doctor patient interaction i just can't show\h
those because of patient privacy but in reality\h\h

35
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,880
that is the type of empathetic listening that\h
happens when a good doctor is seeing a patient\h\h

36
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,000
i listen to people i allowed them to speak they\h
allowed me to speak i got pretty good info out\h\h

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,840
there to counter some of the misinformation that\h
was said or people believed initially though that\h\h

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:30,880
the criticism shifted from me being a pharma shill\h
me being indoctrinated to that my posture was bad\h\h

39
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:39,680
that I shrimp a lot and that I have gotten\h
extremely morbidly obese aka calling me fat\h\h

40
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:48,480
but it wasn't your run-of-the-mill body shaming it\h
was some kind of hyper masculine protestosterone\h\h

41
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:57,360
type ribbing and I say ribbing quite lightly\h
because they were being really mean about [Music]

42
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:07,440
it look I have definitely put on weight since\h
my boxing days in fact in order to have boxed\h\h

43
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:14,240
I lost about 30 lb because when you're training\h
two a days and burning 3,000 calories between\h\h

44
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:21,680
those two workouts and only consuming 2500 or\h
so you're losing weight every single day so\h\h

45
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,520
yes for my fight I got down to 182 lb but that\h
is not my normal walking around weight that was\h\h

46
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:37,280
extreme weight loss for my body so yes over\h
the last 2 years or so I probably gained 40\h\h

47
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,840
to 50 lbs where I would have liked to just put\h
on the 30 lb that I initially lost i'm under no\h\h

48
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,720
illusion that I've gained some weight i'm under\h
no illusion that father time catches us all and\h\h

49
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,840
that these grays are legit and that my empathetic\h
posture that Rib here loves is like this it's been\h\h

50
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,360
commented on Reddit before even on my curbside\h
consult videos unlike some people when they debate\h\h

51
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,960
someone else do stuff like this with their posture\h
I actually want to get into this kind of posture\h\h

52
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,560
where I'm looking to not overpower them i'm taller\h
i'm bigger i don't want to seem even larger so I\h\h

53
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:21,600
try to get even smaller and get on people's level\h
so yes you caught me i'm admitting it here i\h\h

54
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,280
gained weight i am not the healthiest I've ever\h
been and my posture sucks i will be losing that\h\h

55
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,000
weight but what what people will not be losing is\h
the record of the things that they have said to\h\h

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,560
me because while they have deleted their posts\h
I have screenshotted them and I'd like to read\h\h

57
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,480
some of them aloud right now first of all thank\h
you Amy you've deleted this tweet it went viral\h\h

58
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,920
got millions of views and you wrote "It's so scary\h
that doctors aren't taught nutrition like how can\h\h

59
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:54,640
you take their advice seriously when they live\h
such unhealthy personal lives?" interesting that\h\h

60
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,080
people think you have to be ripped in order to be\h
healthy first of all completely untrue second of\h\h

61
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,600
all as I said during the debate doctors make the\h
worst patients we're hypocrites but it doesn't\h\h

62
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,760
necessarily make the information that we're\h
providing be untrue i even said that to one\h\h

63
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,200
of the participants that hey doctors are humans\h
and just because they're not following their own\h\h

64
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,040
advice doesn't make it less factually accurate not\h
hating or anything but he looks older no no no no\h\h

65
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,640
i am older i've been on YouTube for almost\h
a decade that's facts not opinions and these\h\h

66
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,560
gray hairs are because of you doc you on a weight\h
gaining process yeah I'm bulking it's not summer\h\h

67
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,680
yet remember that was 3 months ago i could be\h
ripped right now i'm not but I could be he's at\h\h

68
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,880
least 20% body fat that's fat well like look when\h
we did our BMI video I was talking about how DEXA\h\h

69
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,960
scans are really accurate for measuring body fat\h
body impetence meters you could use a caliper but\h\h

70
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,680
the worst one is getting your body fat measurement\h
done via Twitter by a comment of a named Michael\h\h

71
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Duggan thanks bro appreciate the inaccurate body\h
fat measurement oh Rob Smith an individual who I\h\h

72
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,680
actually met in the green room at Fox News Studios\h
cuz you know I used to do mornings with Maria\h\h

73
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,040
Barter Romo for like 3 years who was quite polite\h
to me and I was polite to him i was like "Oh cool\h\h

74
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,640
a nice guy getting along." And then he writes this\h
the most terrifying part of this is not that the\h\h

75
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,720
antivaxers who have valid and responsible concerns\h
about the current childhood vaccination schedule\h\h

76
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,760
industry is that Dr mike got fat poor one out for\h
his previous hotness folks it's gone sir that is\h\h

77
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,080
your opinion and you could actually enjoy that\h
opinion just kind of mean that you chose to put\h\h

78
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,040
it out on social media if you DM'd it to me\h
probably be less offended for some reason dr\h\h

79
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:49,120
mike looked disgusting gut protruding in his blue\h
scrubs at the debate very disrespectful they need\h\h

80
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,040
to look at those clips on I don't know if it's\h
Tik Tok or YouTube where people are like "Look\h\h

81
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:58,160
what I can look like when I sit in uncomfortable\h
position and look how much abs I have when I just\h\h

82
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,280
sit up or suck in my gut." He used to be called\h
the world's sexiest doctor no one called me that\h\h

83
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,200
people magazine called me hottest doctor alive\h
or sexiest doctor alive they didn't say worlds\h\h

84
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,360
they didn't talk about a geography and now I'm a\h
regular looking dude with poor posture you know\h\h

85
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,200
what spoiler alert i was a regularl looking dude\h
then with the same posture but slightly less body\h\h

86
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,920
fat so not much has changed when will they make\h
a vaccine for love handles yo I get that vaccine\h\h

87
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,640
their camera and lighting made you look fat nope\h
that was all my doing it's giving doughy and\h\h

88
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,640
impotent at least that's a medical comment medical\h
and cooking put together scrubs are not forgiving\h\h

89
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,560
i appreciate that and I definitely have gained\h
some weight and guess what i'm going to lose that\h\h

90
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,040
weight and I got to improve my cholesterol now\h
I'm doing psyllium husk decreasing my saturated\h\h

91
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,600
fat just trying to be healthier overall you\h
know what makes it hard to be healthy negative\h\h

92
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,240
comments online that's the unfortunate reality\h
according to gay Twitter he's a whale is that\h\h

93
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:03,280
like a bear but more buoyant i saw so many mean\h
comments towards the participants i'm not a fan\h\h

94
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,120
and it's not because I'm upy and I don't like\h
calling people names i'm from Brooklyn i get it\h\h

95
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,080
but calling people stupid while they may\h
feel good to you because ego boost to you\h\h

96
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,880
that you're smarter than them it's not valuable\h
nor is it truly fair because if you grew up with\h\h

97
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,320
certain circumstances around you or learning about\h
terrible things that happened to your culture you\h\h

98
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,480
may also end up believing inaccurate things and\h
that's not to say that everything people believe\h\h

99
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,840
in those situations is inaccurate there's always a\h
little bit of truth there maybe it's not the most\h\h

100
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:42,400
rational but it is what is most likely to happen\h
to the human mind the human mind is capable and\h\h

101
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:49,120
is very susceptible to emotional reasoning that is\h
why I try to get on the same page so that we can\h\h

102
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,800
decrease that emotional reasoning and perhaps get\h
to a more factual basis for our understanding and\h\h

103
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,240
that's where usually people start understanding\h
where I'm coming from okay sorry pause you've been\h\h

104
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,880
voted out by the majority thank you appreciate\h
that i also saw a lot of feedback of people\h\h

105
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:11,040
getting mad about the format me not being able\h
to fully fact check everything that the person\h\h

106
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,360
was saying but guess what if a patient comes in to\h
my exam room and is very passionate and is saying\h\h

107
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,400
a lot of things that perhaps aren't accurate or\h
they've been misled by someone I don't rush to\h\h

108
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,560
correct everything that's not a valuable strategy\h
in order to form a good doctor patient alliance\h\h

109
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,640
and in reality when you're practicing medicine\h
on a practical level you have time constraints\h\h

110
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,560
i don't have an hour with every patient that's\h
not realistic so the fact that things got cut\h\h

111
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,600
off and were incomplete was kind of similar\h
to what happens in real life and I will say\h\h

112
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,000
perhaps I didn't even feel that notion that a lot\h
of you have felt where every time I was making a\h\h

113
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,440
good point people voted me off i think what was\h
happening a lot of the time was if someone was\h\h

114
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,960
saying something that the audience wasn't feeling\h
like the participant across from me and they were\h\h

115
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,640
kind of just rambling they picked up their\h
flags and that's fair because it seemed like\h\h

116
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,760
the conversation was going nowhere if I answered\h
and the answer seemed to be complete and they\h\h

117
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,440
felt like okay we get what Dr mike is saying they\h
raised their flags i don't think they were trying\h\h

118
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:27,120
to actively silence me a I don't think they were\h
unified enough to have organized that and B I\h\h

119
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,200
think that they were there in enough good faith\h
that they wanted to hear me talk all that to say\h\h

120
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,760
I'm not defending the fact that I've gained some\h
weight that my posture is not great but please\h\h

121
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:44,880
for God's sake stop body shaming people it doesn't\h
help them and honestly it doesn't help you because\h\h

122
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,320
whatever false ego boost that you get in that\h
moment to make you feel better that I got to dig\h\h

123
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,280
on someone isn't really valuable it's not going\h
to make you happy and it's certainly not going\h\h

124
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:02,240
to help anyone lose weight so just cut it out and\h
speaking of body shaving folks on Reddit in the\h\h

125
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,520
past have accused me of being fat phobic and I\h
actually responded to that controversy you could\h\h

126
