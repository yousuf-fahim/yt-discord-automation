# Migration to Modern Architecture - Complete ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Package.json Scripts
- ✅ `"main"`: Changed from `api/listener.js` → `src/main.js`
- ✅ `npm run dev`: Now uses `src/main.js` with nodemon
- ✅ `npm start`: Now uses `src/main.js` for production
- ✅ Legacy scripts moved to `:old` suffix for backward compatibility

### 2. Added API Folder to .gitignore
- ✅ Added `api/` to `.gitignore` to prevent future commits
- ✅ Marked as deprecated architecture

### 3. Created Deprecation Documentation
- ✅ Added `api/README-DEPRECATED.md` with migration details
- ✅ Documents why old architecture was deprecated
- ✅ Explains benefits of new ServiceManager architecture

### 4. Updated Main README
- ✅ Updated architecture section to highlight ServiceManager
- ✅ Changed transcript method from yt-dlp to youtube-transcript-api
- ✅ Updated setup instructions for modern architecture
- ✅ Updated cache management documentation

### 5. Verified Deployment Configuration
- ✅ Procfile already correctly points to `src/main.js`
- ✅ Package.json main entry point updated
- ✅ All npm scripts now use modern architecture

## Architecture Comparison

### Old Architecture (api/) - DEPRECATED ❌
```
api/listener.js       → Direct Discord client setup
api/transcript.js     → Complex yt-dlp with fallbacks (HTTP 403 errors)
api/summary.js        → Direct OpenAI calls
api/report.js         → Manual scheduling
```

### New Architecture (src/) - CURRENT ✅
```
src/main.js                         → ServiceManager entry point
src/core/service-manager.js         → Dependency injection
src/services/discord.service.js     → Clean Discord service
src/services/transcript.service.js  → youtube-transcript-api (reliable)
src/services/summary.service.js     → Managed OpenAI service
src/services/report.service.js      → Service-managed scheduling
```

## Development & Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev          # Development with auto-restart
npm start           # Production mode
```

### Heroku Deployment
```bash
git push heroku main  # Automatically uses src/main.js via Procfile
```

## Verification ✅

- ✅ Bot starts successfully with ServiceManager
- ✅ All services initialize properly
- ✅ Transcript extraction working (youtube-transcript-api)
- ✅ No yt-dlp errors or HTTP 403 issues
- ✅ Structured logging with timestamps
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Live test: Successfully extracted transcript for video qO-Ctcvrd4s (16,369 characters)

## Migration Complete

The migration from the old api/ architecture to the modern src/ ServiceManager architecture is now complete. The bot is more reliable, maintainable, and deployable.
