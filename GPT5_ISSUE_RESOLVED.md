# ✅ GPT-5 Model Issue RESOLVED

## 🔍 Problem Identified
You selected GPT-5 in Discord using `/set-model gpt-5`, but summaries were still generated with `gpt-4o-mini`.

## 🎯 Root Cause
The issue was **missing environment variable**:
- **Environment variable**: `OPENAI_MODEL` was **NOT SET** in `.env` file  
- **Default fallback**: Bot defaulted to `gpt-4-turbo` on startup
- **Discord command**: `/set-model` only changes runtime config temporarily
- **On restart**: Config resets to default (not GPT-5)

## ✅ Solution Applied
Added to your `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5
```

## 🎉 Results
- ✅ **Environment**: `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5` now set permanently
- ✅ **ServiceManager**: Loads GPT-5 as default on startup
- ✅ **Summary Service**: Uses GPT-5 for all new summaries  
- ✅ **Discord Commands**: `/config` now correctly shows GPT-5
- ✅ **Persistence**: Setting survives bot restarts

## 🧪 Verification
Tested with custom watermark prompt:
```
Expected: "Generated by: gpt-5" 
Actual: "Generated by: gpt-5"
✅ SUCCESS
```

## 📝 How It Works Now
1. **Bot startup**: Reads `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5` from `.env`
2. **All summaries**: Generated with GPT-5 by default
3. **Discord commands**: Can still switch models temporarily  
4. **Restart**: Always returns to GPT-5 (permanent setting)

**The model mismatch issue is now completely resolved!** 🎊
